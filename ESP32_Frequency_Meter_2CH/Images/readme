The accuracy of the measurements is impressive!
See measuring the two oscillators with 15.999 Hz signals on both channels of the ESP32 Frequency Meter.

Arduino Console:
Frequency CH0: 15,999 Hz
Frequency CH1: 15,999 Hz

Checking measurements with an oscilloscope.

ESP32 Freq Meter 2CH board 20 MHz.JPG

Testing my old Crystal Oscillators - 20.000 MHz and 14.318180 MHz. Very Good!

Breadboards and long wires are susceptible to noise and can interfere with measurements. The ideal is to assemble the entire circuit on a printed circuit board and use shielded cables on the frequency meter inputs. But I will wait for other new implementations to the project.

The two outputs of oscillators 0 and 1 are not being used in this test.
