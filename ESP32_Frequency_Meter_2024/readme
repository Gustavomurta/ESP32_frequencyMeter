Best Frequency Meter ever made with ESP32 - awesome! (Arduino Version)

For the happiness of those interested in the project, I am posting an update to the code and schematics.
I chose another library for the LCD I2C Display. Simpler and functional with the new ESP32 firmware.
I removed the option to connect directly to the LCD, as it was confusing for some.
I changed the inclusion of some ESP32 libraries, to make them compatible with the new ESP32 firmware.

Connect the oscillator output to the frequency meter input to perform tests.
Use the serial console (Arduino IDE - 115200 bps) to change the oscillator frequency for testing.
Use resistors R1 and R2 to equalize the voltage level on the I2C bus to 3.3V used in ESP32.

If you are in doubt about the I2C address of your I2C LCD module, use the I2C scanner.
